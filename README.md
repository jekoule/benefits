# Benefits

This is a web application for employee engagement startup. The idea is simple: small and medium-sized business can use this platform to offer large bundle of perks to their employees just as large corporations do. There are several well-known companies working in this industry worldwide, e.g Fond.co (former AnyPerk) in US, Perkbox in UK. This project was aimed to build similar service for Kazakhstan.
The application developed allows to add and manage companies, employees, available perks. There are separate interfaces for HR managers, regular employees, partners, project administrators.
Unfortunatley, this startup project has been frozen due to low demand from local businesses.

## Used technologies:
